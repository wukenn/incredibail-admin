Incredibail.sol is a completely separate set of two smart contracts developed on the Solidity browser IDE. It implements basic functionality of Incredi-Bail, tracking the basic status of a client, their contacts, and accepts donations in the form of Ether. The address/wallet of donors are tracked, so when time for a refund, the owner will get the amount they donated back to their wallets, less a service fee.
